There is a price tag on everything;
A dying language beat down like a featherweight, staggering.
Once you've had bad credit,
You'll never forget you had it.
Dim innuendos are spoken aloud
Where supermodels are superendowed.
Fashion is the art of brainwashing the proud.
The shocking inclination
(The vulgar ostentation)
The group inoculation
(The sketchy motivation)
The holy exaltation
(The misappropriation)
The underestimation
This is the thrilling conversation you've been waiting for.
Ears down to the noise floor
Just to hear the sound.
The adjectives are everywhere, I stand down
This is the fascist ex-purgation
The people's liberation
The teen emancipation
The tintinnabulation
This is the thrilling conversation you've been waiting for,
This is the thrilling conversation you've been waiting for.
(Disassociate if you can't support it,
Don't try on the suit if you can't afford it.)
