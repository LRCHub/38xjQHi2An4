How long?...
Cuts between my eyes...
How long?...

I am waiting for the end
The great last good-bye
The sighing of the confused ones
In the essence of a lie

Kings of their own thrones
A cut between my eyes
My work is done the crowd is dead
There's nothing left but lies

And every kind of falling down
Will be welcomed underneath my crown...

I'll protect you from the world
Outside there in this noisy cage
Don't be angry, raise your head
Our weapon will be rage
All the faces wearing masks
We'll cut them into stars
Then as kings we'll get the unction
The cure of thousand wars
