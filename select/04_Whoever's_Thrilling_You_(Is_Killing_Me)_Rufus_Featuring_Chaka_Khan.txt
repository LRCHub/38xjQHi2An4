I don't want see you tomorrow
If I can't see you today
You've been puttin' me off for so long
I got the feelin' something's wrong

Chorus:
Whoever is thrilling you is killing me

I haven't seen you in so long
Right now your just a voice on my telephone
You say you'd see me tomorrow
But my tomorrow's are filled with sorrow

Chorus:
Whoever is thrilling you is killing me

Put all my faith in you
You see the girls growin' numb
I don't even know where you're calling from
You got me in a state of confusion
I need a love transfusion

Chorus:
Whoever is thrilling you is killing me
